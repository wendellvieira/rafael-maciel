                    Hacking Rio is the biggest Hackathon of Latin America. 
                    More than 500 hackers were there, creating solutions for 
                    education, gas, insurance, cybersecurity, energy etc. I was in

                    know soccer team from Brazil. My team was 4 developers of

                Flamengo has more than 42 million of fans. But the local stadium, Maracanã, has the capacity for 90 thousand. 
                Without tickets for all the fans, the only way to watch the game is on the television. So, we asked fans about the feeling of being at the stadium in order to develop a better experience of watching a soccer game at home.

                    Being part of the largest hackathon in Latin America, with more than 1,000 participants, was an even
                    more incredible experience, since my challenge was to develop a product for Flamengo, the biggest
                    soccer team in Brazil, which has one of the biggest fans in the world. world.

                    As the only designer who worked with 4 developers on the team, I was also responsible for organizing
                    the research and ideation processes (design thinking) and creating the backlog. In the end, the 
                    product was ready and was very well rated. At each moment of a hackathon, you wonder how an MVP
                    will be ready so quickly and it will end up happening. It is a very rewarding experience.
