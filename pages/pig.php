                </p>
                <p>
                    Pig was developed during Hacka Gr1d 2019.
                    The main sponsor, Gr1d, is an api marketplace for life insurance companies. For the hackathon, Gr1d invited 40 tech professionals to explore the apis and create disrupt products regarding investments and life insurance business.
                    We got first place, yesss! and iPhone XRs for each member of the team, Wow. But the best of it is the opportunity that we’re having to develop the product with this lovely team.</p>
