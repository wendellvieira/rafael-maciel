                    Rio de Janeiro is the worst city for commuting, according to an Expert Market Consultant research. In a ranking of 74 big cities around the world, Rio is in the last position. Their citizens takes 90 minutes to go to work. It's almost 3 hours in traffic every day.
                    <br><br>
                    The worse traffic times are:<br>
                    7–9h: going to work or taking kids to school;<br>
                    12–13h: getting kids from school;<br>
                    17–20h: arriving from work or school;<br>
                    <br><br>
                    At school hours, besides the increasing number of cars, the streets that are next to the schools gets a nightmare, with a lot of parents cars blocking up the traffic.

                    During the Uber hackathon in Brazil, I can say that my biggest learning was about business. There were mentors specialized and at all times we were asked about business models, how the product would be monetized, how much it would cost, what the first month of operation would be like, etc. I learned a lot about giving importance to business. I used to say I was an attorney for the user, today I say that I look for the meeting point between the needs of users and the needs of the business. Thanks Shawee and Uber, it was an awesome experience.
