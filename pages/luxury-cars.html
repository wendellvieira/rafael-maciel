                        <p>
                            All car pages will appear in search engine results. Considering this scenario, the user will start the flow at the car page and will fill the form to know if the car is available at the desired location, date and time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If it's not, the website will show the car selection page saying that the car is not available for now, but with a new list with a similar model in the first place. For example: if you check if a Porsche Carrera is available, and it's not, the website will show other Porsche models first and then will show cars in the same category, in this example, Sport Cars.

                            silhouette if the respective illustration isn't

                    One of the first insights that I had in the start of this project was that those are the most beautiful cars, 
                    just like pieces of art. So, why not make an almost invisible product? The cars talk for themselves. And 
                    it was a great idea, the visual design was highly rated by users. <br>
                    <br>
                    After this project, I learned a mindset to always keep the experience as simple as possible. The 
                    complexity has to run from behind, not being visible to the users. I've readed a lot about this advice 
                    and it was a great learning putting it into practice.
